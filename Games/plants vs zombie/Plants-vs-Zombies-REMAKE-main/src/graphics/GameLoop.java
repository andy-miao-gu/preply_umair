 * A very simple structure for the main game loop.

 * Note that to make this work, none of the 2 methods
 * in the while loop (update() and render()) should be
 * long running! Both must execute very quickly, without
 * any waiting and blocking!
 *
 * Detailed discussion on different game loop design
 * patterns is available in the following link:
