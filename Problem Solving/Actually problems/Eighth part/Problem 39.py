## show me all possible cominations of x and y


## psundo oocoodoeoo


## make a empty list

## run a nested for loop from y

    for eb in y:
        combosaaaaal.append((ea,eb))


## then append ((e1,e2)) to the list)

for each in combosaaaaal:
    if each[1] > each[0]:

##show only those combinations in whcich second value is more than 1st value
